![Baldur's Gate 3 Shaders for Substance Painter - Unofficial Texturing Resources.](https://github.com/V0ln0/BG3-Substance-Painter-Shaders/blob/main/Screenshots/Logo_header.png)

## Overview
Intended as a modding resource these are recreation of specific Baldur's Gate 3 shaders in Substance 3D Painter. The goal is to take the guess work out of creating Baldur's Gate 3 compatible texture maps, by giving artists a more accurate preview of their work and simplifying the workflow. In addition to the shaders, there are also file templates, and a variety of export presets for different situations.  

There is also a PDF containing an in-depth guide containing more detailed information on these files, which I recommend you read over purely relying on this readme. 

### Installation
1. Go to Substance Painter's 'assets' folder (ie, C:\Users\user\Documents\Adobe\Adobe Substance 3D Painter). 
2. Take the 'assets' folder from inside the downloaded .zip file, and merge it with the one inside Substance Painter's directory (merge files if promoted). 
3. You're done, for further instructions see the provided PDF guide.
