![Baldur's Gate 3 Shaders for Substance Painter - Unofficial Texturing Resources.](https://github.com/V0ln0/BG3-Substance-Painter-Shaders/blob/main/Screenshots/Logo_header.png)

## Overview
Intended as a modding resource these are recreation of specific Baldur's Gate 3 shaders in Substance 3D Painter. The goal is to take the guess work out of creating Baldur's Gate 3 compatible texture maps, by giving artists a more accurate preview of their work and simplifying the workflow. In addition to the shaders, there are also file templates, and a variety of export presets for different situations.  

There is also a PDF containing an in-depth guide containing more detailed information on these files, which I recommend you read over purely relying on this readme. 

### Installation
1. Go to Substance Painter's 'assets' folder (ie, C:\Users\user\Documents\Adobe\Adobe Substance 3D Painter). 
2. Take the 'assets' folder from inside the downloaded .zip file, and merge it with the one inside Substance Painter's directory (merge files if promoted). 
3. You're done.

## Currently Supported Shaders
## Skin

Gives you full control the character's skin colour using the same parameters found in-game, said parameters are also fully compatible with values found Baldur's Gate 3 files; allowing you to work with as much accuracy as possible. 
While some features have been omitted from the full in-game version of the shader for the sake of efficiency, you are still provided with a number of additional features on top of the skin colour. 
These include:
- Bodyhair colour
- Non-Skin features (such as the 'teifling hornplates' and nails/claws)
- Tattoo/makeup atlas'

In the shader settings you are also able to disable the lighting to view your project as flat colours, in addition you are also able inset CancelMap_MSK texture directly into the shader instead of making it draw from channel data.

## Armour
![Baldur's Gate 3 Shaders for Substance Painter - Unofficial Texturing Resources.](https://github.com/V0ln0/BG3-Substance-Painter-Shaders/blob/main/Screenshots/Workspace_Armour.png)
Like the skin shader, the armour shader allows for full controll over the colour of your porject, once again using the same paramaters found in-game. 
The shader also comes with an option to disable the colour overlay in order to just view just the base colour of your work
The velvet effect found on some assets in-game is currently unsupported.
