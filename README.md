![Baldur's Gate 3 Shaders for Substance Painter - Unofficial Texturing Resources.](https://github.com/V0ln0/BG3-Substance-Painter-Shaders/blob/main/Screenshots/Logo_header.png)

## Overview
Intended as a modding resource these are recreation of specific Baldur's Gate 3 shaders in Substance 3D Painter. The goal is to take the guess work out of creating Baldur's Gate 3 compatible texture maps, by giving artists a more accurate preview of their work and simplifying the workflow. In addition to the shaders, there are also file templates, and a variety of export presets for different situations.  

There is also a PDF containing an in-depth guide containing more detailed information on these files, which I recommend you read over purely relying on this readme. 

### Installation
1. Go to Substance Painter's 'assets' folder (ie, C:\Users\user\Documents\Adobe\Adobe Substance 3D Painter). 
2. Take the 'assets' folder from inside the downloaded .zip file, and merge it with the one inside Substance Painter's directory (merge files if promoted). 
3. You're done, for further instructions see the provided PDF guide.

## Skin

Gives you full control the character's skin colour using the same paramaters found in-game, said paramaters are also fully compartible with vaules found Baldur's Gate 3 files; allowing you to work with as much accuracy as possible. 
While some features have been omited from the full in-game verison of the shader for the sake of efficency, you are still provided with a number of additional features ontop of the skin colour. 
These include:
- Bodyhair colour
- Non-Skin features (such as the 'teifling hornplates' and nails/claws)
- Tattoo/makeup atlas'
